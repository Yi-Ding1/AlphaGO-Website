			<h1>What are some similar emerging technology developments?</h1>
			<p>The idea of building a neural network to enable the machine to learn things and the concept of reinforcement learning can be applied to all other games. DeepMind created similar AIs for games like Space Invaders, and now they are working towards more complicated 3D games such as Doom.</p>
			<p>Playing Go is just a way to test how effective an AI is at problem solving. Deep neural networks and reinforcement learning can be utilized for other fields such as facial recognition, self-driving car and so on.</p>
