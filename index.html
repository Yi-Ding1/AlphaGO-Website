			<h1>Introduction</h1>
			<p>AlphaGo is a computer program developed by DeepMind that plays the board game Go. Go is played between two players, using either black or white stones, take turns placing their stones on the Go board. The goal is to gain spaces of territories and capture your opponentâ€™s stones. There is a total of 19x19 points, black needs 185 points to win and white needs 177 points to win (185+177=19x19+1) since black goes first.
			</p>
            <p>On 15 March 2016, AlphaGo played against South Korean professional Go player Lee Sedol, one of the best players at Go, and AlphaGo won four out of five games. Later on 29 December 2019, AlphaGo Master (new version) played sixty online games against professional players with a record of 60 wins and 0 losses. AlphaGo is no doubt the strongest Go player in the world.</p>
