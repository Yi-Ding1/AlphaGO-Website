			<h1>What are the ethical considerations?</h1>
			<p>Although AlphaGo provided Go players a faster way to discover new moves and improve their skills, some people think AlphaGo ruined Go. </p>
			<p>First of all, AI provided players a way to cheat in online games. In September 2020, South Korean player Jing Enchi cheated using AI in Korea’s professional online Go competition, which results in her getting suspended from all competitions for a year. </p>
			<p>Another concern is that Go is a game for human to continuously discover new strategies, the existence of Al completely revolutionized Go by providing everyone with the model answer. Instead of trying to discover new strategies, most professional Go players focus on trying to get the same move as AI nowadays. This model answer may have ruined the fun of human discovering more strategies in Go and it might bury the unique play styles of some professional Go players. This same concern goes for all other games as well. </p>
